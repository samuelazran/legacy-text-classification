text-classification
-------------------

text-classification is a python package that uses popular ML libraries such as scikit-learn to simplify text classification tasks

the tasks are divided into 3 main modules:
---------------------------------------------
	1. tester - perform grid search for the best classifier and parameters set for the data, or run test on saved classifier and parameters
	2. learner - train model on the data given classifier and set of parameters
	3. predictor - use the saved model to predict the class of input text


the package is being developed in my spare time. if you'd like to use or improve it, you are more than welcome to contact me at: samuel azran (in one word) at gmail.
